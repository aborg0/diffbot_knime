Diffbot KNIME extension
=======================

This client makes easier to use the diffbot automatic APIs ([article](https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/article/) and [analyse](https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/analyze/)) from KNIME, which can ease the text-processing tasks.

For usage, you will need a token from [diffbot](http://www.diffbot.com/pricing/).

The released versions contains the built update site, you just have to add the update site to KNIME and accept the license (those are not signed, so you will have to accept that unsigned feature too).
