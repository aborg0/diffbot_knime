      The Article API is used to extract clean article text and other data from news articles, blog posts and other text-heavy pages. Retrieve the full-text, cleaned and normalized HTML, related images and videos, author, date, tags -- all automatically, from any article on any site.
The KNIME client can use diffbot to visit the page and provide the results as a JSON value. You need a token to use these services: http://www.diffbot.com/pricing/
